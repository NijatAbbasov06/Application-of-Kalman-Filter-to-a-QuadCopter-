# Application-of-Kalman-Filter-to-a-QuadCopter-


This project includes a drone model developed using PX4 autopilot, ROS2 and Gazebo. The goal of the repository is to simulate the Quadcopter model under harsh conditions with ROS2 and Gazebo.

Using Extended Kalman Filter, Fault Tolerant Control algorithm methods will be developed.


Right now, the repository is under development and packages inside /ws_sensor_combined/src is being tested and studied for understanding ROS2 and PX4 architecture, the middleware used for the communication between PX4 and ROS2 nodes and topics and etc.
